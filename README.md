Using GameCreator 1 and Enviro how to set the time via lighting

This creates a custom Action for GameCreator 1, allowing you to specify the:
* Year
* Day of Year
* Hour (24 hour clock)
* Minute

To keep it at the current minute I would recommend setting Time and Location Controls > Time > Progress Time to None. 

To use this script you must have the following in your Unity Game:
[Enviro - Sky and Weather](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/enviro-sky-and-weather-33963)
[Game Creator 1](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/game-creator-89443)
